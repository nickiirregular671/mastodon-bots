# ActivityPub / Mastodon bots

A Mastodon (Activity Pub) bot instance developed in PHP to quickly create and deploy multiple bots. I use the bots to regularly post interesting content (historical photos).

See it in action: https://bots.ambience.sk/

## Installation

Download the code or clone using git.

**Pure PHP**, no external dependencies.

**Apache server needed** because of **.htaccess rewrite rules**. But these could be easily converted to NGINX.

**SQLite** used as a database for low friction setup (database = single file).

See **Setup your fist bot** below...

## Features

Multiuser (multibot) Fediverse instance. I recommend to host it on a domain or a subdomain. `index.php` is used to handle all traffic via rewrites.

### Public website

Public facing website with list of bots and their posts including their profiles and full Mastodon feeds.

Automatically generated based on the bots and their activity. Fully indexable by Google and other search engines. Verification via rel="me" included as well as bot creator META tag.

### Admin

- **Full administration panel** - create and manage your bots (multiple bots per instance)
- **Login:** single admin user - authenticated via password only
- **Dashboard** - quick overview of bot activity and their stats
- **Manage bots**
    - create
    - edit
    - post as a bot
    - social features - follow or block
    - move - migration from (_alsoKnownAs_) and to (_movedTo_) an instance
- **Logs** - log of all relevant events (incoming and outgoing) for all bots
- **Settings** - Mastodon instance setup, log retention, media limits

### Bot API

Very **simple API** to communicate with your bots.

#### Supported features
- Create a post
- Upload media
- Post with media (use ID from upload response)
- Edit a post (but you can also do that manually via Admin)
- Delete a post (but you can also do that manually via Admin)
- Follow a remote account

Example (creating a Mastodon post):
```
curl -u botname:botpassword \
     -X POST https://example.com/api/post \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"content":"Hello Fediverse! #test","visibility":"public"}'
```

## Setup your first bot

1. Setup your instance by going to: example.com/admin/
2. Set domain/subdomain to be used for your ActivityPub / Mastodon instance.
3. Create your admin password
4. Login using your password.
5. **Create New Bot**, set username (no @ character), display name, short bio, password for the bot (keep it for later API access)
6. **Edit** your bot to enter additonal details (extra fields, featured hashtags) and upload your profile icon (avatar) and a header image. Set options such as discoverability, featuring in Mastodon explore, search engine indexing, followers approval. All options preset for full visibility.
7. **Settings** and change log retention and media upload limits as needed.
8. See **API Usage** under settings for simple API communication with your bots.

Note: Computer-assisted process was used to develop this code.
